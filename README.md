Hey you! Yeah, you! Are you constantly changing your workspace and in need of reeinstalling Docker over and over again? 

Are you tired of having to add the Docker repo, dowloading the images AND having to write your own docker-compose.yml just to get a simple Docker network? 

Are you alway forgeting the command to resize the vm.max_map count? Then this Bash script might be just what you need!
